## Installation Guide (On AWS)

### Prerequisites

1. **AWS CLI Installation and Configuration**:
   - Ensure that the AWS CLI is installed and configured with the appropriate permissions.
   - Run the following command to configure your AWS CLI:
     ```bash
     aws configure
     ```
   - Make sure the credentials provided have the necessary permissions.

2. **Required AWS Services**:
   - You will need access to the following AWS services:
     - EC2
     - S3
     - Lambda
     - DynamoDB
     - CloudWatch
     - EventBridge

3. **Locate Key Pair**:
   - You will need to specify the key pair name in the `conf.ini` file.
   - The location would be `~/.ssh/your-key-pair.pem`

### Configuration

1. **Setting Up Regions**:
   - Define the regions to use in the `conf.ini` file. You can specify multiple regions or a single region.
   - Example configuration for `conf.ini`:
     ```ini
     regions_to_use = us-east-1, us-west-2
     ```
   - **Recommendations**:
     - Use `us-east-1` as the default region, especially for S3 buckets, DynamoDB, CloudWatch, and EventBridge, as they are typically initialized in `us-east-1`.
     - When you specify multiple regions, the resources will be created in all the regions specified.

2. **Key Pair Configuration**:
   - Specify the key pair name in the `conf.ini` file.
   - Example configuration for `conf.ini`:
     ```ini
     key_pair_name = your-key-pair
     ```

3. **Instance Type and Number of Instances**:
   - Define the instance type and the number of instances to launch in the `conf.ini` file.
   - Example configuration for `conf.ini`:
     ```ini
     instance_type = m5.2xlarge
     number_of_instances = 3
     ```
   - These settings allow you to specify the EC2 instance type and the number of instances to run in each region.
   - **Note**: As an example, the configuration includes a sleep time to simulate the start of an instance. Later, you can replace the sleep command with your actual startup script (in ec2 script and lambda code) to execute the tasks required.

### Execution

Hereâ€™s the updated section with the additional instructions:

---

### Execution

1. **Running the Scripts**:
   - To deploy the resources, execute the following script:
     ```bash
     ./run_all_in_one.sh
     ```
   - The script will prompt you for confirmation before proceeding. Press `yes` or `enter` to continue.
   - Note if you are running Galaxy, you can omit step2_FindLinuxAMI.py in the script, since we have to use the Galaxy AMI.

2. **Launching Spot Instances**:
   - After deploying the initial resources, navigate to the directory containing the Spot Instance scripts:
   - Execute the following Python scripts sequentially to configure and launch your Spot Instances:
     - Step 1:
       ```bash
       cd step6_SpotInstance
       python3 step1_CreateAndCopySecurityGroup.py         
       python3 step2_FindLinuxAMI.py
       python3 step3_StartSpotInstances.py
       ```
   - During the execution of these steps, you may be prompted for additional inputs or confirmations. Follow the prompts as instructed, and the rest of the process will be taken care of by the scripts.

### Cleanup

1. **Deleting All Resources**:
   - To delete all the resources created by the scripts, run the following command:
     ```bash
     ./delete_all_resources.sh
     ```
